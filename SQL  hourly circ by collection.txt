Here is a script that may be what you are looking for.  It assumes you have access to the MS SQL Server Management Studio on you Production server.  Make changes to the 3 SET lines for your organization.

DECLARE @OrganizationID int
DECLARE @StartDateTime datetime
DECLARE @EndDateTime datetime
SET @OrganizationID = '9'
SET @StartDateTime = '2011-07-01 00:00:00.000'
SET @EndDateTime = '2011-07-31 23:59:59.999'
SELECT *
FROM PolarisTransactions.Polaris.Aggregates WITH (NOLOCK) WHERE AggregateTypeID = 49 AND OrganizationID = @OrganizationID AND StartDateTime >= @StartDateTime AND EndDateTime ORDER BY StartDateTime
