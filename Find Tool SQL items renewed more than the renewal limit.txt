You could run this SQL query from the Item Find Tool which would give you a list of items that have been renewed more than the renewal limit:

SELECT ItemRecordID AS RecordID
FROM CircItemRecords CIR WITH (NOLOCK)
JOIN ItemCheckouts IC (WITH (NOLOCK)
ON CIR.ItemRecordID = IC.ItemRecordID
WHERE IC.Renewal >  CIR.RenewalLimit
