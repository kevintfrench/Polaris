Yes, those are the parameters you would have to change.  You can find collection and statistical code ids in Administration.  Go to Administration—Collection, search for your collection and then right-click and open the collection.  The Collection ID number will be in the Title Bar.  It is also available by checking the File—Properties, About tab.  It’s listed as ‘Polaris ID number.’  Statistical codes are available in System—Policy Tables—Item Statistical Class Codes.  When you double-click a line in that table, you will get the statistical code id in the Title Bar.
 
You can also use SQL to look up all of your collection and statistical codes.  I printed those out and tacked them to my bulletin board since I use them so much.
 
Or you could just eliminate some of those parameters completely—some libraries don’t use the stat class code for much.

Hi Chris,
Won’t the id numbers in these lines vary from library to library. I know my assigned branch id =3 and not 9, for example
 
where th.transactiontypeid=6001 
and td.transactionsubtypeid=38 
and cir.statisticalcodeid=110
 
Where do we go find ID numbers? In Administration?

If you run this in the SQL find tool, you will get the top 10 bib records associated with items having a particular statistical code, collection code, and owning library.  This totals up all of the circs for all items associated with the bib record that meet the criteria you set:
 
SELECT BR.BibliographicRecordID as RecordID
from bibliographicrecords br (nolock)
where br.bibliographicrecordID in
(select top 10 cir.associatedbibrecordid 
from PolarisTransactions.Polaris.TransactionHeaders TH (nolock)
JOIN PolarisTransactions.Polaris.TransactionDetails TD (nolock)
on th.Transactionid = td.transactionid
JOIN Polaris.CircItemRecords CIR (nolock)
on CIR.ItemRecordID=TD.numvalue
JOIN Polaris.bibliographicrecords br (nolock)
on CIR.AssociatedBibRecordID=BR.BibliographicRecordID
where th.transactiontypeid=6001 
and td.transactionsubtypeid=38 
and th.transactiondate > '04-01-2012'
and th.transactiondate < '05-01-2012'
and cir.assignedbranchid=9
and cir.assignedcollectionid=6
and cir.statisticalcodeid=110
group by cir.associatedbibrecordid, BR.LifetimeCircCount
order by count(th.Transactionid) DESC, BR.LifetimeCircCount DESC)

I am looking for a report of the 10 most popular titles in a collection.  I thought I had seen this request in the  past but am not finding it anywhere and am stumped on how to go about this.  I’d like to do this with simply reports if possible.
