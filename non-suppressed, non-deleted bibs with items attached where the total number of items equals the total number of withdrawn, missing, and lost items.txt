non-suppressed, non-deleted bibs with items attached where the total number of items equals the total number of withdrawn, missing, and lost items:

SELECT BR.BibliographicRecordID as RecordID 
FROM BibliographicRecords BR (NOLOCK)
LEFT OUTER JOIN RWRITER_BibDerivedDataView RW (NOLOCK)
ON BR.BibliographicRecordID = RW.BibliographicRecordID
WHERE RW.NumberofItems = (RW.NumberWithdrawnItems + RW.NumberLostItems + RW.NumberMissingItems) AND RW.NumberOfItems > 0
AND BR.RecordStatusID= 1 AND BR.DisplayInPac = 1
(If you do not care about whether a bib is suppressed from the PAC, you can delete the last line.)
