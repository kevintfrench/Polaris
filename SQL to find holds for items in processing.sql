--Here is the one I created for our libraries. This report also sorts the titles by type of material and is designed for a consortium where we have to specify the assigned branch as the same as the pickup branch. (In this example, --it is 29.) You may be able to leave that out. Of course, I'd be interested to see if others have created better scripts.
