TH.TransactionTypeID 6012 has no SubType =129.  So the first query is excluding all of the transactions with TransactionTypeID=6012 right off the bat.  Which is probably a good thing because you’re counting pretty much the same thing with the Checkin->Transferred and Check-in->In-transit.  I would rewrite the query as such:
 
SELECT COUNT (*)
FROM PolarisTransactions..TransactionDetails TD WITH (nolock)
INNER JOIN PolarisTransactions..TransactionHeaders TH WITH (nolock)
ON (TH.TransactionID = TD.TransactionID)
WHERE TH.TransactionTypeID = 6002 AND TD.TransactionSubTypeID = 129 AND TD.numValue in (5,6)
AND (TH.TransactionDate BETWEEN '2010-10-24 00:00:00.000' AND '2010-10-24 23:59:00.000')
 
It should give you the same number but it makes more sense when you read it.
 
The second query is giving you far more results because of the first clause in the WHERE statement : (ActionTakenID = 11 or ActionTakenID = 22 or ActionTakenID = 29)
 
One checkin may result in more than one action taken.  You should chance that statement to simply ActionTakenID = 11.  It looks like that may still short you some transactions, however, as there are other ways for an item to transfer to In-Transit or Transferred without being checked in.  If you are wondering (as was I) what those methods are in your database, run this:
 
SELECT ActionTakenID, count(ActionTakenID)
from Polaris.ItemRecordHistory WITH (nolock)
where ActionTakenID not IN (11,22,29)
AND NewItemStatusID IN (5,6)
AND (TransactionDate BETWEEN '2010-10-24 00:00:00.000' AND '2010-10-24 23:59:00.000')
Group by actiontakenid
 
I have no idea about the SimplyReports result.

Subject: [Polaris Admin Forum] Need SQL Help - Number of items put into transit during a specified time period
 
Hi All,
 
I need some SQL help.  We’re trying to estimate the number of items we sort (or at least need to sort) during a specified time period based on the number of items set to Transit or Transit Hold during that time period.
 
I’ve tried 2 different SQL queries resulting in 2 widely differing answers, plus used SimplyReports as a control – that result hits in the middle.
 
Query 1, result 1,690:
 
SELECT COUNT (*)
FROM PolarisTransactions..TransactionDetails TD WITH (nolock)
INNER JOIN PolarisTransactions..TransactionHeaders TH WITH (nolock)
ON (TH.TransactionID = TD.TransactionID)
WHERE (TH.TransactionTypeID = 6002 or TH.TransactionTypeID = 6012)
AND TD.TransactionSubTypeID = 129
AND (TD.numValue = 6 OR TD.numValue = 5)
AND (TH.TransactionDate BETWEEN '2010-10-24 00:00:00.000' AND '2010-10-24 23:59:00.000')
 
Query 2, result 2,918:
 
SELECT COUNT (*)
from ItemRecordHistory WITH (nolock)
where (ActionTakenID = 11 or ActionTakenID = 22 or ActionTakenID = 29)
AND (NewItemStatusID = 5 OR NewItemStatusID = 6)
AND (TransactionDate BETWEEN '2010-10-24 00:00:00.000' AND '2010-10-24 23:59:00.000')
 
SimplyReports, Item Count Report, with Item Date Filter In-transit sent date specified as 10/24/2010 to 10/24/2010 and only output column is Item Sending Branch Name.  Did early on 10/25, logically before any materials put into transit on Sunday would still be in transit and not yet received.  Result:  2,160.
