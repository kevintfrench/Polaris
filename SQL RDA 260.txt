Forum Post:
This information is some of the "tricky" data that SimplyReports tends to avoid, as pulling data from the subfields in a MARC record involves a lot of table joins in Polaris.  In addition, the publisher can be in the 260 OR the 264, depending on how progressive your library has been about RDA cataloging.  Below is the SQL query I use for a report of recently added titles for some of our libraries.   I'm not sure what would happen if there were multiple instances of the particular field we were searching, but that worry isn't important in this case.
