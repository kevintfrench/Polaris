--This is a snip of our code that looks through existing material in the "wild" and moves it to a different branch location. We do this since our main library branch leverages an automated material returns machine and we wanted the material to come off of the patrons record when it was returned.
--This runs every hour...

--This moves material checked out to our patrons to a specific "resting" branch that the automation machine is also set to. When an item comes across the belt it checks the item "in" and lives in that "resting" branch for a set period of time. Items on hold or that do not fit the standard category are put into the exceptions bin and are handled manually by our staff.

--We then follow up with a removal of the quarantine once a day that will take the items out of the "resting" branch and move them back to the standard workflow for our library (based on our time allotted to quarantine).
