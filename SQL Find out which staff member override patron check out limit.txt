I took a look and there is a transaction type for “Supervisor override transactions”. Based on the information it provides about the privilege that is overridden this looks like what you’re looking for. I threw together a SQL statement to grab the datetime, the user account and the privilege overridden. In the code provided it only looks at the last seven days, but that could be adjusted.
 
select th.TransactionDate, pu.Name as 'Username', tds.TransactionString as 'Privilege Overridden'
from PolarisTransactions.polaris.TransactionHeaders th
inner join PolarisTransactions.polaris.TransactionDetails td  on
                ( td.TransactionID = th.TransactionID and td.TransactionSubTypeID = 190 )
inner join polaris.polaris.PolarisUsers pu on
                ( pu.PolarisUserID = td.numValue )
inner join PolarisTransactions.polaris.TransactionDetails td2 on
                ( td2.TransactionID = th.TransactionID and td2.TransactionSubTypeID = 191)
inner join PolarisTransactions.polaris.TransactionDetailStrings tds on
                ( td2.numValue = tds.TransactionStringID )
where th.TransactionTypeID = 9001 and th.TransactionDate >= DATEADD(DAY, -7, GETDATE())
order by th.TransactionDate desc
