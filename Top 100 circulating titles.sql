--Hello Does anyone have a report that will list the top 100 circulating 
--titles (with circ total) within last 365 days by collection or format?
-- Or, is there a way in Simply Reports to produce this report? Any help 
--is appreciated. We are on 3.5, build 455.

--I think I have something along those lines...

--This will have to be modified, since it has some things in it specific to our site (e.g., which stat codes are in each category).  But it could serve as a starting point.  --Hopefully the mailing list software won't censor it too badly...
