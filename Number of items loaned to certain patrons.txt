As JT mentioned, you can get the stats from a couple places.  Luckily, the transactions database keeps certain information that doesn't directly identify the patron, so you can still get stats.  Here is the list of details available for each check out transaction (trasnactiontype = 6001).



TransactionSubTypeID	TransactionSubTypeDescription

264	NextHoldRequestID

300	Vendor Account ID

302	Patron Postal Code ID

38	ItemRecordID

124	Renewal

61	Assigned Collection Code

123	Patrons Assigned Branch ID

60	Item Statistical Code

6	PatronID

224	TermID

33	PatronStatClassCode

233	HoldRequestID

125	Items Assigned Branch ID

4	MaterialType

7	PatronCode

145	Checkout Type

220	CourseReserveID

296	Shelf location

186	Checkout Date

268	Item Home BranchID







Assuming you don't purge anything, there's a wealth of information available!  I believe (but someone may correct me), that stats like patroncode will be kept even if you purge identifying information (which I think would just remove the patronID).  Each checkout includes the PatronCode and ItemAssignedBranchID as subinformation about the transaction.  You can get the count of checkouts (including renewals) from this query

You mentioned wanting to know the number of items.  What is the question exactly?



1) These X unique items were checked out or renewed a total of 300 times to Reciprocal Patrons?  For this, we need to add another join to the TransactionDetails to get the itemID, then we just select unique itemIDs.





SELECT DISTINCT(td3.numvalue)

FROM PolarisTransactions.Polaris.TransactionHeaders AS [th] WITH (NOLOCK)

--items assigned branch id

LEFT OUTER JOIN PolarisTransactions.Polaris.TransactionDetails AS [td1] WITH (NOLOCK)

LEFT OUTER JOIN PolarisTransactions.Polaris.TransactionDetails AS [td2] WITH (NOLOCK)

--Item Record ID

LEFT OUTER JOIN PolarisTransactions.Polaris.TransactionDetails AS [td3] WITH (NOLOCK)

ON th.TransactionID = td3.TransactionID AND td3.TransactionSubTypeID = '38'

AND td2.numValue = '5'

AND th.TransactionDate BETWEEN '07/01/2012 00:00:00' AND '06/30/2013 23:59:59'


2) I checked out (not renewed) 100 items to reciprocal patrons (could be the same 5 items being checked out over and over to different patrons).  For this we need to eliminate renewals.
