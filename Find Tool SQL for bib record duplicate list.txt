I posted a Item Record Find Tool SQL search last week that would find multiple copies at the same branch.  I’ve had a request for the Bibliographic Record Find Tool SQL search that will find duplicate bib records, so here it is:
 
SELECT DISTINCT BR.bibliographicrecordid AS RecordID
from polaris.bibliographicRecords BR WITH (NOLOCK)
join polaris.bibliographicISBNindex BIN1 WITH (NOLOCK)
ON BIN1.BibliographicrecordID = BR.BibliographicrecordID
join polaris.bibliographicISBNindex BIN2 WITH (NOLOCK)
ON (BIN1.bibliographicrecordid <> BIN2.BibliographicrecordID) and 
(BIN1.ISBNstring = BIN2.ISBNstring)
 
When you get your results list, you can sort by title and merge away.  One caveat here is that this search is designed to find bib records that have the same ISBN as some other bib record in your database.  If you have an audiobook or a book/CD kit or a large print book that has the regular print ISBN included in the record, you may get some results that are not truly duplicate bib records. Be careful about what you merge.
