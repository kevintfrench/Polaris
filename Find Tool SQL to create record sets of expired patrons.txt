Here is the Find Tool query I use to create record sets of expired patrons.  Staff at the branches are then responsible for deleting the patrons.
-- set find tool to export results to record set
-- give record set a name and increase the record limit
-- change the orgid to refelct the correct branch
-- make sure the record set reflects correct ownership
-- adjust expiration date
 
select PR.Patronid as RecordId  from Patrons P (nolock)
inner join PatronRegistration PR (nolock)
on (PR.PatronID=P.PatronID)
where PR.ExpirationDate < '2006-12-31'
and P.LostItemCount=0
and P.ChargesAmount=0
and p.organizationid=3
and P.patronID NOT IN
(SELECT patronID FROM ItemCheckouts)
