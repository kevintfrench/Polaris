This report gives a list of items in a consortium or multi-branch system that have been shipped to a given location to fill hold requests over a range of days, counted backward from today’s date.  It should be run on PolarisTransactions.  I created it to see if there are any glaring holes in our collection development.
 
The variable parameters in the report are @Location (the OrganizationID of the receiving location) and @Range (the number of days to cover in the report, counted backward from today).  The total circulations are grouped by BibRecordID.  Enjoy!
