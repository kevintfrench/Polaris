In the two places where it says “IR.AssignedBranchID = 3” you will need to replace the 3 with the branch ID that you want to use for the project.  Voila, you get a list of duplicate items.  But it wasn’t simple to create this list and I had to make some judgment calls, so I’m going to go over what I did with you.
