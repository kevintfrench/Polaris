I think the two Querys below will do what you want.  The first one I ran the to find the PostalCodeIDs and the corresponding PostalCode, City and Country. The second I used to update the PostalCodeID for patrons and limits the update to those patrons in a specific recordset and where the address has the 99999 Missing City listed (PostalCodeID = 0).
