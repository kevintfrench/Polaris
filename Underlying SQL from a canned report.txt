Open the web interface for Reporting Services, so on mine production server, I go to: http://servername/reports and in that interface, I navigate to the report I want to edit (or in your case, view). Click the “Show Details” button to get the advanced layout, and then click the “edit” icon next to the report you want. On the general page, there are two links under Report Definition – Edit and Update. Click on Edit. This will prompt you to Open or Save the file. I always Save it, and it will then save the .rdl file to my server. I can then open the .rdl in Reporting Services and see the report entirely – layout, SQL, etc. And then, if the SQL includes a stored procedure, well – I answered how to view that too.
