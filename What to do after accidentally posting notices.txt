Unfortunately once the notices have been posted to the database they cannot be retrieved. When you click Yes, the notices are posted (recorded) as issued, and the appropriate queue for the notice type and branch is cleared. However the set of notices remains available in the workstation’s My Documents/My Reports folder, and can be reprinted from that location. Please note: the file is overwritten each time notices are generated.
