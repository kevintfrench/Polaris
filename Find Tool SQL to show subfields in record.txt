If you mean subfield e in the 300 tag field, try dropping this into the bib record Find Tool SQL search box:



Select DISTINCT BR.BibliographicRecordID as RecordID

FROM BibliographicRecords BR with (nolock) join BibliographicTagsAndSubfields_View BT with (nolock) on BR.BibliographicRecordID=BT.BibliographicRecordID

WHERE BT.TagNumber='300' and BT.Subfield='e'



This is a handy search - just change the tag field number and subfield as needed!  And if you don't need the subfield, just delete that last bit.
